# custom-device-driver
Created a custom device driver for the Linux operating system I installed in the ZYBO Z7-10 FPGA. This custom device driver allows the FPGA to its multiplication Hardware I desgined for it to multiply numbers on the operating system.  I also created a user application that tests to see if the device driver is working by testing if the driver can multiply numbers from 0 to 16 together correctly.
